## Python Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, TKinter Recipe Recommendation System Project

In this project, I created a recipe Recommendation system based on [Food.com 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) utilizing a few statistical concepts with Pandas and NumPy, adding real value to project with links to actual recipies and photos with BeautifulSoup and creating easy-to-use GUI with TKinter. Project consists of:

* The Approach: detailed explanation of the concepts used to recommend the recipies (food.ipynb)
* The Execution: the practical implementation and demonstration of the system, running the system and showing its output (food.ipynb)
* The Interface: simple look of the application for real-world usage (food_app.py)
